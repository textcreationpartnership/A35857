         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tutor.</speaker>
               <p>MY Dear Pupil, you are welcome to <hi>Oxford,</hi> I am glad to ſee you remember your old Friends, and hope you have not forgot thoſe excellent Principles you learnt from your careful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Univerſity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pupil.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I can never forget my Friends, nor would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly act contrary to ſuch Principles as would be for their Service, and the general good of Mankind.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tu.</speaker>
               <p>Hum! that's well ſaid, if it be well intended; but I do not know what to make of that expreſſion; for methinks the good of Mankind ſounds a little odly in theſe Factious and Seditious Times, and I am a little jealous, that the Coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48921:3"/>and Clubs in <hi>London,</hi> have taught you to ſpeak ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort of Language than you did here in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pu.</speaker>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, when I left <hi>Oxford,</hi> I preſently loſt the Art of diſputing about words, but I'le aſſure you Sir, I really intend what I ſpeak.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tu.</speaker>
               <p>Prethee then ſpeak plain Engliſh, and tell me that you are for the King, and the Church, and let your Mankind alone.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pu.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I am very much for the King and the Chnrch, and a little alſo for the Reſt of the People; for if I ſhould <hi>diſpoſe of them out of the way,</hi> the Prince might call me to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for his Subjects, and you for your hearers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tu.</speaker>
               <p>You know my meaning well enough; Are you for the Prerogative and Government in Church and State? As for the People, it's their buſineſs to obey their Superiors, to pay their Tythes, and their Taxes; and, if occaſion be, to Fight for the Glory and Honour of their Prince, and the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pu.</speaker>
               <p>And is this all that comes to their ſhare? Indeed a very conſcionable Reckoning; but I have no mind to diſturb you at preſent, and therefore ſhall onely tell you, that I am heartily for the Prerogative and Government as by Law Eſtabliſht.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tu.</speaker>
               <p>As by Law Eſtabliſht; why, there's a Dry Bob again; What if there was no Law?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pu.</speaker>
               <p>Then there would be no Tranſgreſſion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tu.</speaker>
               <p>I ſay, Suppoſe there were no common or Statute Laws, (as you call them) yet Government ought to be ſubmitted to as its the Ordinance of God, and of Divine Right, and conſequently Obedience to our Governours is due from us, on pain of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, without the help of an Act of Parliament.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pu.</speaker>
               <p>Nay <hi>Tutor!</hi> if we muſt diſcourſe of theſe matters, pray let's ſit down and do it ſoberly; I will allow you that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in general is the Ordinance of God, and of Divine Right,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48921:3"/>for without it, there could be no ſuch things, as humane Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the World, which makes St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>13th</hi> to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> affirm as much of all Powers, none excepted, but then as to the kinds or different ſpecies of Government, God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty has left no ſtanding Ordinance, whereby to prefer or command one kind above another, and its abſurd to think he ſhould, except we do Imagine that there ought to be exactly the ſame frame of Government throughout the whole World, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the variety and difference, of Climates, of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts and Inclinations of People in particular Nations, and that all, who differ from us in their Policies, (as all do more or leſs) do therein violate God's Ordinance, which is equally ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and uncharitable. Therefore the particular kinds of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, muſt have another and lower Fountain to flow from, which can be no other than humane. In ſhort, the higher Power or Magiſtracy it ſelf, is God's Ordinance, that it Reſides in one or more, in this or that Family, in ſuch or ſuch a way, is purely from humane deſignment; which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s meaning, when he calls Magiſtracy <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, humane Creature: St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it God's Ordinance, becauſe the Power is from God: St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls it humane, becauſe the ſpecification of it to this or that Form, is from the Societies of Mankind. And by this time Good Tutor, I ſuppoſe you perceive, that were it not for the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Laws and Cuſtoms of <hi>England,</hi> your <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> would go near to leave our beſt Friends in the lurch; for though we ſhould all agree, there ought to be a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet it's two to one we ſhould not agree, whom, in what, and how far to Obey. If you have any thing to object, pray let me hear it; for I would neither lead, nor be led into the leaſt Error in things of ſo high Concernment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tu.</speaker>
               <p>My dear <hi>Pupil,</hi> we are now under the Roſe, and you ſhall be my Confeſſor, what you ſay, ſeems highly rational, but to tell you the truth, we ſeldom trouble our heads
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48921:4"/>with things of this nature, foreſeeing that an unlimited and naked <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> is much more for our eaſe and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, and if it would but go down with the People, we promiſe our ſelves from it all the effects of whatſoever Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pu.</speaker>
               <p>To the honeſty of ſuch dealing I ſhall ſay nothing, nor can I deny, but ſuch a civil Superſtition, would for ſome time at leaſt, mightily advance that Order of men that manag'd it, and qualifie them for the ſame Grandeur and Power under all changes of Government; but certainly it leaves the reſt of the Community, both Magiſtrates and People, in a moſt precarious and miſerable Condition; for though Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy be God's Ordinance, yet if you lay aſide the particular Laws of the Country which determine it, the Exerciſe of it is no more confined to one man or Family than another, and whoever happens to get the Power, by your Rule would have the Right, and ſo you make no difference between an Uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and a lawful Prince, and equally oblige the People in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the one as to the other, a Doctrine odious to all good Subjects.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tu.</speaker>
               <p>Pray Sir is there no ſuch thing as a Right of Conqueſt, and are no People bound in Conſcience to obey him that has that Title?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pu.</speaker>
               <p>I will not put you out of Countenance, by applying your Queſtion to a caſe that happened within our own memory, but ſhall rather deſire you to conſider how its poſſible for force alone, to create a better Title over publick Societies, than it would do in the caſe of each private man? Suppoſe then a Stronger man meets me, and violently throws me upon the ground, is it not lawful for me to riſe again without asking him leave? ay and to trip up his heels too, whenever I ſee my opportunity. Apply this to publick matters, and then tell me, whether your mighty Conqueror be not in a hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal condition, when Millions of men ſhall be at perfect Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48921:4"/>to ſhake off his Yoak, whenever they can take him at an advantage. And ſo long as nothing but bare force obliges men to a ſubmiſſion, ſo long will a Right of diſcharging themſelves of that force continue in the People to the end of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But where the People are not bound by contract to any other Lawful Prince, its then in their choice, whether they will come into a moral Condition of Subjection to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror or no: If they will not, they dye or remain a Free People as to any moral Obligation. But if on the one ſide the People be unwilling any longer to ſuffer the miſeries they are under, or have no Ability to make reſiſtance, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror on the other ſide, finds his forceable Dominion over them inſecure and uneaſie, I ſay, if upon ſuch Conſiderations as theſe, they mutually agree upon a Contract and Compoſition of Rule and Subjection upon ſuch and ſuch terms, the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror now has loſt that name, and his Government thencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward muſt be ſuch, as the fundamental Contract makes it to be, and the Rightful Dominion in the Prince, and Duty of Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the People, will be ſo ſtated and limited, as was conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon in the Original Agreement. And I am perſuaded it will appear an uncontrollable Truth in Policy, that the Conſent of a People, either by themſelves, or their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, is the only means (without ſpecial Revelation) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Magiſtracy is conferred on any Perſon or Family; neither can God's Ordinance be conveyed, and People engaged in Conſcience any other way.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tu.</speaker>
               <p>I confeſs, I now begin to think that the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Mankind, have more to do in theſe matters than I was aware of; and it's more than probable that all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment whatever is very much for their ſakes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pu.</speaker>
               <p>To me it ſeems plain, That the Common Good of Humane Societies, is the Firſt and Laſt End of all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for <hi>nulla poteſtas datur ad malum;</hi> ſo in effect ſaies St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the 13th. to the <hi>Romans</hi> (ſpeaking of Rulers)

               <p>Now you put it hard upon me <hi>Tutor,</hi> and I dare not undertake to give you full Satisfaction in ſo thoughtful a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but you ſhall have more than my Gueſs. And how I cannot chooſe but own the Goodneſs of Almighty God, in the Architecture of our Government, whereof I do declare my ſelf ſo great an admiror, that whatever more than humane Wiſdom had the contrivance of it, whether done at once, or by degrees found out and perfected, I conceive it unparallel'd for exactneſs of true Policy, in the whole world; Such care for the Authority of the Monarch; ſuch proviſion for the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Property of the People, and that one may be juſtly allaid, the other upheld, and yet conſiſt without Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of each other, that I wonder how our fore-fathers in thoſe eſteemed rude and unpoliſht times, could ever attain to ſuch an accurate Compoſure.</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:48921:5"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> then, Suppoſe a People compelled to it by the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Conqueſt, or agreeing to it by free conſent, Nobles and Commons ſetting over themſelves, by publick compact, one chief Magiſtrate, and reſigning up themſelves to him and his Heirs, to be governed by ſuch and ſuch fundamental Laws, whereby the chief Magiſtrates power is radically limited to one legal courſe of exerciſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe in all Governments after-cauſes will ariſe, not within the proſpect of humane fore-ſight, requiring ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Laws, <hi>pro re natâ;</hi> and alſo becauſe the original frame it ſelf may in ſome caſes ſtand in need of an Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Interpretation, or would of courſe and by degrees moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der away and decay, if not carefully repaired and look't af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſuppoſe them therefore covenanting with their Prince, that (if there be occaſion in order to any of the aforeſaid purpoſes) there ſhould be conventions of all degrees of men amongſt them, to provide ſuitable remedies and expedients for all the ſeveral exigencies and diſeaſes of the State; and if at any time there ſhould be need of new Laws, that the Prince himſelf ſhould not have the ſole power of making them, but they reſerve at firſt (or afterwards it's granted them, which is all one) an hand of concurrence therein, and that they will be bound by no Laws but what they joyn with him in the making of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe, though the Nobles may perſonally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene, yet the Commons, being ſo many, cannot all of them come together; it's therefore agreed, that each County and Corporation ſhall have power to depute ſome particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be inſtead of the whole, that ſo the Nobles being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in perſon, the Commons by their Deputies, there may be repreſentatively the whole body of the Kingdom, having Commiſſion by the original conſtitution to make new Laws, or to guard and repair the old ones.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:48921:6"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Becauſe the cauſes of their meeting would not be conſtant and perpetual, they therefore did not form theſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates to be conſtantly exiſtent, but occaſionally, yet intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally, and virtually provided for their meeting whenever there ſhould be occaſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Becauſe a Monarchy was intended, therefore as great power (as was conſiſtent with other parts of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment) was inveſted in the Prince, in order to his better diſcharging the executive part of the Law; and conculding, that he who was to govern by Law, and for the furtherance of whoſe Government for the good of the people, the new Laws were to be made, would thereby be engaged to ſee the convention of theſe Eſtates take place, as of right it ought to do whenever there is occaſion; they therefore aptly plac't the formal part of nominating the time of Convention in the executive Power, to be made uſe of as the reaſon of its being lodged there ſhould require.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It being found by experience in proceſs of time, that Princes not caring to have the male-adminiſtration of their Miniſters look't into, or to have any power in act but their own, did therefore take advantage of this their nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of time when the Eſtates ſhould meet, and made uſe of it ſeldomer than need required (an inconvenience, which had it not been provided for, would have beaten down the Government at once, and utterly defac't the whole frame of the Conſtitution); to prevent which, that <hi>Tacit</hi> principle of having frequent Parliaments, was litterally explain'd by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Statutes made in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain'd to the having Annual ones.</p>
               <p>And now Sir! when you have made all theſe ſuppoſitions in your mind, I am confident you have very much of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del and platform of our Government.</p>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48921:6"/>all Intereſts with the greateſt Juſtice and Equity in the world; and to me it ſeems evident, that though the convocating the Eſtates, and bringing them into exiſtence, has ſuch a formal dependance on the Kings Writ, as you have declared; yet exiſting, and when convocated, they work by an innate Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and by the priviledges of their original Inſtitution, their Acts then being not Commiſſionated like thoſe of other Courts, but proceeding in conjunction with the Kings, which makes me the better underſtand that uſual clauſe in our Acts of Parliament which tells us, that ſuch and ſuch a thing is enacted, &amp;c. not only by and with the advice of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Aſſembled, but alſo by the Authority of the ſame— But you'l ſay, I ought not to comment upon a Text I have learnt ſo lately—therefore pray proceed, for I cannot doubt but you have yet more to ſay upon this Subject.</p>

               <p>By no means, Sir! except it includes ſomething that is not literally expreſt; for though our Anceſtors have taken care, that there ſhall be frequent meetings of the Eſtates, yet if they have not provided for the continuance of their Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons when met, that ſo their coming together may poſſibly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer its end, what does all the reſt ſignifie? and therefore pray tell me your opinion in that point.</p>

               <p>Nay, hold a blow there, good Tutor! I had rather you had ask't me all the hard queſtions in <hi>Euclid;</hi> not ſo much for any difficulty in the ſolution, as becauſe it's an ill time of the year to diſcourſe of ſuch matters; therefore I think we had beſt ſtop here—And yet I find I am a little like Sir <hi>Martin,</hi> now my hand is in, I can't forbear fumbling with the ſtrings, though I don't care to play out; wherefore I will not promiſe you an Anſwer: but when I have ſaid what I think convenient, if you pleaſe you may give your ſelf one.—
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48921:7"/>there are wiſe and learned men (and who upon a good occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion may be ſpoke with) that do conceive there is a Statute made in the time of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second,<note place="margin">See the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute verbatim, with the Clauſe Roll.</note> and now in being, though not in Print, which provides, that no Parliament ſhall be diſmiſt till all the Petitions are anſwered, which I think comes home to the point; Bills in thoſe days, many times appearing in the form of Petitions: as not long ſince we had an excellent Law made, called the Petition of Right, ſubſequent to this Statute: and particularly in the Reigns of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th, Henry</hi> the <hi>5th,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>6th,</hi> it was uſual for Proclamations to be made in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> before the end of every Seſſions, that all thoſe that had any matter to preſent to the Parliament, ſhould bring it in by ſuch a day; for otherwiſe the Parliament at that day would deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. And all this being bare matter of fact, there can be no other Queſtion about it, but whether it be ſo or no.</p>
               <p>But for diſcourſe ſake, Let's ſuppoſe this Statute, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent practiſe all out of doors, and that there is no memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of Record extant of any ſuch matter, and then it will be impoſſible in this or any other like caſe, to make a true Judgment, without having recourſe to ſome fixed and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rule, which (in matters of Government, where poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Laws are ſilent) can be no other than the fundamental Architecture, and original frame of the Conſtitution, ſome particulars whereof relating to our preſent diſcourſe, I muſt be forced to call over again upon this occaſion: you muſt mind then, that our wiſae Anceſtors in modelling our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, had not only an eye to the Power and Authority of the Monarch, but alſo to the Liberties and Properties of the People (things eaſily conſiſting in themſelves, and mutually aiding and aſſiſting each other) and foreſeeing that the moſt exact prudence could not make particular proviſion for all occurrences that might happen, and that if time (that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48921:7"/>great Innovator, as the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> calls it) would of courſe, and knavery, and folly (by their influence) by degrees make things worſe and worſe; and if wiſdom and counſel were not as conſtantly watchful to make them better and better, the beſt founded Government in the world muſt in tract of time infallibly come to ruin; they therefore laid it as the Baſis of our Policy, that there ſhould be frequent meetings of the States, to ſupply all defects, and ſtop up all Crannies, or violent Fractions, as they ſhould happen, to the prejudice of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Conſtitution. In the next place, conſider what part the Monarch was to bear in theſe Conventions, not to have a ſole power, but to go in conjunction with the Nobles and Commons, all acting by the principles and authority of the firſt Inſtitution: and what that Learned Prince, King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>1ſt,</hi> ſays of Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Power in general, may be well applied to it in this particular, <hi>viz.</hi> the Law is the meaſure of the Kings Power: and if it be the meaſure of it, then is the Power limited by it; and the fundamental Law ſaying, There ſhall be Conventions of the Eſtates, to encounter and provide againſt publick and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive miſchiefs whenever they happen; By neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, a time for them to meet, and a convenient time of ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to do ſomething when they are met, are included, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the known Rule in your Schools,—He that commands a thing to be done, does with the ſame breath command all ſuch circumſtances, as without which the thing commanded cannot take effect. And indeed common reaſon ſpeaks the ſame: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe time of meeting, and a convenient time of ſitting, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the very ends and beings of Parliaments, therefore muſt the Execution, or bringing them into Act, be lodged ſomewhere; and though with the beſt Decorum and convenience, it fell to the ſhare of the chief Magiſtrate to be intruſted with the hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary and formal part of Summoning and pronouncing the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions of Parliaments, yet the Law (which is his rule as well as ours) has plainly enough determined how, and when he ſhall do it.</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:48921:8"/>
               <p> In the laſt place, the deſign and wiſdom of the firſt Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects of our Government, is very apparent, in contriving a Monarchy in the Prince, mixed with <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> in the Houſe of Peers, and <hi>Democracy</hi> in the Houſe of Commons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all the advantages were ſecured, and inconveniences avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which are ordinarily to be found in ſimple and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded States: for here is a ſingle perſon endued with a ſufficiency of Power for Diſpatch, and to diſcharge the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive part, without danger of a long laſting Tyranny; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Councellors (in whom the Scripture ſays there's ſafety) Nobles and Commons, coming from all quarters of the Land, as eye-witneſſes of the ſeveral Exigencies of the State, and tied up to all imaginable ſincerity by their own intereſt; I ſay, the Prince has theſe to aſſiſt and join with him in the Deliberative and Legiſlative part, without danger of ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Factions, too frequent in ſimple <hi>Ariſtocracies;</hi> or diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered confuſion, which many times happen in ſimple <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracies:</hi> each of theſe Eſtates by the wiſdom of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment moderating and reſtraining from exceſs the Power of the other. Now therefore whatever ſhall deſtroy this Coali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Mixture, and place the whole ballance of all things in any one of the Powers, can you think it warranted by the Policy of our Conſtitution? And whether a ſingle Power chuſing whether ever a Parliament ſhall ſit or no; or if aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, whether it ſhall continue a convenient time to do any thing or no, does not amount to as much, is highly worth your conſideration.</p>

               <p>I remember you told me, that Statutes have been made for the Annual ſitting of Parliaments; ſuppoſe that heretofore thoſe Laws were litterally put into execution for ſeveral years ſucceſſively—Writs went out at the day, the Counties and Corporations (thinking to build up a Sanctuary for their hopes and fears) cheerfully neglected their Seeds-time and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, and with great charge and trouble made their Elections, the elected members left their Families and Eſtates behind
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48921:8"/>them, and made long pilgrimages in order to attend upon the publick Service; but had ſcarce ever time to pull off their boots, before they were diſmiſt again by a Prorogation or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; would the true intent of thoſe Statutes be thus ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied? And did the Legiſlators intend nothing more by them, than that the Lords and Commons ſhould have an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of coming up to the Parliament-houſe purely for the ſake of going down again?</p>

To begin therefore with the laſt Parliament but one; did it not open with all imaginable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of grace and favour from the King, that any good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject could deſire, either for the preſervation of Religion, his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and property at home, or for ſupporting our Neighbours and Allies abroad? nay, did not the King invite the Houſes to uſe all means for their ſecurity (excepting only the matter of the Succeſſion) and when in order to theſe ends, and for the preſervation of <hi>Tangier</hi> a ſupply was ask't, not one penny would be granted.</p>

               <p>I have heard of ſome general Acts of Pardon, that at firſt ſight make a great ſhew of Grace and Indempnity, but when a Tranſgreſſor comes to look over the exceptions, he is commonly bilkt in his expectations; and you would do well to conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the preferring the ordinary courſe of Succeſſion to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be not much of the ſame nature; and I would willingly learn how it's poſſible for a zealous Papiſt to be a good Defender of the Proteſtant Faith; but I reſerve my ſelf in this point till you give me farther occaſion. As to other matters, pray Sir conſider, that we have long laboured under a damnable Popiſh Plot, and that from <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Papers, and what witneſſes have ſworn, it plainly appears that the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators do chiefly rely upon the <hi>French</hi> King for the carrying it on to effect. Now <hi>Tutor!</hi> Money is a real thing, and will certainly do either good or hurt, expreſſions may do neither; and by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament-calculation (which by the way I think more authentick than the Cabals) we can tell the time when a great ſum of money raiſed to ſupply extraordinary occaſions, was imployed to make war upon a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> State, and to advance the Intereſt of this ſame <hi>French</hi> King; and that another round ſum was given for making an Actual War with <hi>France,</hi> and yet I have not heard of many men loſt in the quarrel; I am ſure the then Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer <hi>D.</hi> muſt needs think the <hi>Monſieur</hi> a very ſweet-natur'd Gentleman, that was likely to lend a vaſt Treaſure to his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies <hi>Flagrante Bello.</hi> Therefore pray let's not run too hard upon the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> now we know they cannot ſpeak for themſelves; for it's two to one but they ſaw cauſe to take care of old <hi>England,</hi> before they could come to provide for that hopeful Nurſery at <hi>Tangier;</hi> and to make our ſelves ſtand firm at home, before they could hope to ſupport our Friends abroad.</p>

               <p>Really <hi>Tutor,</hi> if by the Conſtitution of our Government, a Parliament had only been deſigned to be a Conduit-Pipe for the Peoples purſes to run out at, your laſt Objection would be unanſwerable, but as the caſe ſtands, they are to give the King Advice as well as Money; ay and to make that Advice Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative and obligatory to the People. And though it's certainly the Duty of all good Subjects, to conſult the King's pleaſure in all things that are really for his Service and the common good of the Nation, yet under Favour I think the houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons (having a Fundamental ſhare in the legiſlative part, &amp; Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianſhip of the Government) are bound in Conſcience to make the publick good their chiefeſt aim, and if for that end they were forc'd modeſtly to remember the ſurreptitious gaining of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for the continuance of Popiſh Officers, the procuring new Commiſſions for known Papiſts, the aſſaſſinating of ſome, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the turning out of other Proteſtant Magiſtrates for doing their duties, the corrupting of Witneſſes, and forging fatal crimes againſt Proteſtant Diſſenters, the preſſing and Admiſſion of the Romiſh Religion upon a Proteſtant State, by perſons under a publick Character from <hi>England;</hi> and as the Summ of all, A popiſh Influence upon the continuance or Prorogations of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

               <p>But how can you juſtifie their Votes, againſt putting the poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Laws in Execution againſt the Proteſtant Diſſenters, whenas the Judges are bound by their Oaths to execute the Laws, did they not hereby aſſume to themſelves a Power of ſuſpending Acts of Parliament?</p>

               <p>Very well Sir! by this, and by <hi>Dangerfield</hi>'s Evidence I dare lay Eight Pounds a Week, I can ſpell out your meaning, And—</p>

               <p>I know it, and yet the bare mentioning ſuch an Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, during our preſent circumſtances: does naturally make me a little ſerious; and therefore pray conſider that the ſole End of all our Laws, is the publick good, which chiefly conſiſts in the Enjoyment and Preſervation of our Government, our Religion and Properties, and that there has been, and yet is an helliſh and damnable Plot contrived, and carryed on by Papiſts for the ſubverſion of them all. If then it does appear the Proteſtant Diſſenters are a numerous Party in the Nation, and have all along made Head againſt the Conſpirators to the Envy of their
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48921:11"/>Neighbours, and teſtified their zeal to the Proteſtant Religion and Deteſtation of the Plot, at leaſt equally to any other ſort of men (for the truth of which, I dare appeal to the Common Ingenuity of all ſober Church-men, and to the malice of the Conſpirators themſelves, who have put a particular mark of Honour upon their Integrity, by forging Sham plots and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orning falſe Witneſſes againſt them) I ſay if this be their caſe, where then is their Crime, or rather how great was the wiſdom, I had almoſt ſaid Gratitude, of the Houſe of Commons in Vot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing —That it is their Opinion, that the proſecuting Proteſtant Diſſenters upon the poenal Statutes, is at this time grievous to the Subject, an Encouragement to Popery, and Dangerous to the Peace of the Kingdom. And we all know, that moſt of theſe cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Laws, were either new made, or ſcour'd up and furbiſhed at a time when it was natural to paſs from one extream to another; but however the Reaſon of a Law ceaſing, is vertually a Repeal of the Law itſelf, &amp; yet the Houſe of Commons were ſo modeſt as barely to declare their Opinion <hi>pro Tempore,</hi> till a legal Proviſion might be made for Proteſtant Diſſenters in a Regular and Formal way: its plain they did not pretend by their ſingle Vote to alter the Laws, for if they had, why then did they bring in a Bill for Repealing the 35th of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which paſſing both Houſes, was afterwards carefully loſt, leſt ſo precious a Jewel might be wanting upon occaſion? But if State-Oaths do critically oblige all that have taken them, officiouſly to execute whatever Laws are in being, and at all times, without any regard to the good or evil that may enſue. I can neither ſee how Proclamations to put particular Laws in Execution came firſt in uſe, nor ſufficiently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the good Fortune of perſons Reconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prieſts and Jeſuits amongſt ſo many Laws that call them Traitors.</p>

               <p>No more of that I beſeech you; let's now come to the ſhort Liv'd Parliament here at <hi>Oxford,</hi> at the beginning of which, the Houſes were Adviſed, to make the Laws of the Land
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48921:11"/>their Rule, as the King was Reſolved they ſhould be His; and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty was given them to put the Adminiſtration of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into proteſtant hands, in caſe the Crown ſhould deſeend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Popiſh Prince; and yet the Commons could not forbear falling upon the Succeſſion, though the King had told them his pleaſure in that matter beforehand.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pu.</speaker>
               <p>If Parliaments in their Legiſlative capacity, were ſo Tyed up to the Laws in being, as not to have power to Repeal any Old, or make any New ones, how came we to have any Acts of Parliament at all? or how could they provide ſuitable Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies for the Occurrences that happen in every Age, which was one main end of their Inſtitution? It's true indeed, the executive power of the King is Reſtrained to Laws already made, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Vi Termini;</hi> for there cannot be an execution of what has not an Actual Exiſtence, and I am confident this Legal courſe will at long Run be moſt for His Majeſties ſervice, whatever ſome Bankers may have ſuggeſted to the contrary, ſince the ſhutting up of the Exchequer. As to the matter of the Succeſſion, I ſhall ſay the leſs, becauſe more has been ſaid already both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and without doors, than any one hitherto has been pleaſed to anſwer; and if upon juſt grounds, the Parliament has power in a Legiſlative way, to Attaint any Subject whatſoever of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (which cuts off the Man and Inheritance at one blow) their mercy ſure in ſparing you Life, cannot be thought an exceſs of their power; and that the D. <hi>T.</hi> ſucceeding to the Crown in an ordinary way, is inconſiſtent with the welfare of the Nation, is even confeſt by the Oppoſers of the Bill, by their pretending to an <hi>Expedient,</hi> which as it was propoſed, in my poor Opinion, is the greateſt Riddle in the world. For the giving a ſolitary and empty Name of King to one man, and placing the Execution of the Kingly Power in the hands of another, does not only divide the Office from the perſon, and conſequently Revive that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crved deſtinction, between the Natural and Politick Capacity, but ſtrikes at the very Being of Monarchy it ſelf. For if the naked
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48921:12"/>Stile and Title of a King, will ſatisfie the Notion of being a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, and all the Authority and Power may be tranſlated to one other hand, by conſequence they may to more than one, or to many hands, whereby you may have a Monarchy in Name, but in Effect and Reality an Ariſtocracy or Common-wealth, and ſo the Expedient becomes <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> and ſupplants that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it pretends to ſupport.</p>

               <p>Alas poor Monſieur Expedient! why, hark you Pupil, a By-ſtander would think you hired me to make objections on purpoſe that you might anſwer them; but what ſay you to the buſineſs of <hi>Fitz Harris,</hi> and diſagreement of the Houſes about it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pu.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, the buſineſs of <hi>Fitz Harris,</hi> Tutor! <hi>hinc illae Lachri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae,</hi> now you touch a ſore part indeed, which gives me juſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to obſerve and adore the boundleſs mercy and goodneſs of Almighty God, not only in giving warning to this ſinful and ingrateful Nation, of a Damnable Popiſh Plot againſt it, but alſo in carrying on the Diſcovery from Time to Time, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of Infidelity it ſelf, and eternal Reproach of all that Power and Artifice, that have been made uſe of to conceal and ſuppreſs it. And now at laſt in this buſineſs of <hi>Fitz Harris,</hi> we have (as it were) one Riſen from the Dead, to Preach Belief to Infidels. A known Papiſt comes in, and tells us he can no longer bear the Burden of his own Guilty Knowledge, and is therefore forc'd to confeſs, that what the Proteſtant Witneſſes have ſaid, is True, and that Sir <hi>Edmund Eury Godfrey</hi> was Murdered by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts. That the <hi>Dutch</hi> War, and <hi>Black heath</hi> Army had an ill aſpect upon the Proteſtant Intereſt: He tells us of great prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men and money in Forein parts, to carry on this curſed Deſign: And that Ambaſſadors from abroad, and Perſons of the firſt Rank of Subjects here at home, are engaged in the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and who knows but a prudent management of ſuch a Witneſs, might produce a Diſcovery of yet higher Importance; therefore the Houſe of Commons thought fit to take the Cauſe of <hi>Fitz Harris</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:48921:12"/>into their own hands, and to be Eye-witneſſes of his Innocency or Guilt, as to the Crimes objected againſt him, that ſo they might ſatisfie themſelves, and all the world, in the matter of his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. And if ſuch a Cauſe as this (during our preſent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances) be not fit to be heard in the Higheſt Judicatory of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſhall deſpair of ever hearing of any that will not be too little for its cognizance. As to the <hi>Debitum Juſtitiae,</hi> or Right of the Matter, I ſhall ſay the leſs, becauſe ſome of the Noble Lords themſelves in their late Proteſtation, have ſaid ſo much on the Commons ſide. But pray conſider that the Lords were firſt in the diſagreement; for they Rejected the Impeachment, without any previous Conference to give or receive any Reaſons (which manner of proceeding in common converſation, is very unuſual amongſt good Neighbours) and what followed after in the Houſe of Commons, I conceive did not in the leaſt exclude them from giving or receiving ſatisfaction in the matter in difference, but rather made way for a Conference in order to it; the good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects whereof would no doubt have been ſuitable to the wiſdom of both Houſes, had they continued longer together.</p>
               <p>And now good Tutor, if this be all you have to object, I hope you will not take Advantage of the Dead, nor make the Venerable Ghoſt of an Houſe of Commons ſtand up in a Sheet, and do Pennance in your Churches.</p>
